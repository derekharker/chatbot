  role: user
- content: Great! To start solving the equation \(5x = 12\), you should isolate \(x\).
    What do you think you could do to both sides of the equation to get \(x\) by itself?
  context:
  - Answer ? 3 x + 5
  - the left side of an equation one also needs to subtract 5

- content: Divide by 12?
  role: user
- content: Close, but remember that you want to isolate \(x\). Since \(5\) is multiplied
    by \(x\), you should divide both sides by \(5\) instead. What does that give you
    for \(x\)?

- content: Exactly! So now you have \(x = \frac{12}{5}\). If you want, you can simplify
    that or convert it to a decimal. What would you like to do next?

    \(x\) in the equation?
