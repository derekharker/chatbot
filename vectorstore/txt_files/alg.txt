Algebra
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals
with abstract systems, known as algebraic
structures, and the manipulation of expressions
within those systems. It is a generalization of
arithmetic that introduces variables and
algebraic operations other than the standard
arithmetic operations, such as addition and
multiplication.

Elementary algebra studies which values solve
equations formed using arithmetical operations.

Abstract algebra studies algebraic structures, such as

values and seeks to determine for which values
the statements are true. To do so, it uses
different methods of transforming equations to isolate variables. Linear algebra is a closely related field
that investigates linear equations and combinations of them called systems of linear equations. It provides
methods to find the values that solve all equations in the system at the same time, and to study the set of
these solutions.

Abstract algebra studies algebraic structures, which consist of a set of mathematical objects together with
one or several operations defined on that set. It is a generalization of elementary and linear algebra since
it allows mathematical objects other than numbers and non-arithmetic operations. It distinguishes
between different types of algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, and fields, based on the number of
operations they use and the laws they follow, called axioms. Universal algebra and category theory
provide general frameworks to investigate abstract patterns that characterize different classes of algebraic
structures.
Algebraic methods were first studied in the ancient period to solve specific problems in fields like
geometry. Subsequent mathematicians examined general techniques to solve equations independent of
their specific applications. They described equations and their solutions using words and abbreviations
until the 16th and 17th centuries when a rigorous symbolic formalism was developed. In the mid-19th
century, the scope of algebra broadened beyond a theory of equations to cover diverse types of algebraic
operations and structures. Algebra is relevant to many branches of mathematics, such as geometry,
topology, number theory, and calculus, and other fields of inquiry, like logic and the empirical sciences.

Definition and etymology
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures and the operations they use.[1] An
algebraic structure is a non-empty set of mathematical objects, such as the integers, together with
algebraic operations defined on that set, like addition and multiplication.[2][a] Algebra explores the laws,

general characteristics, and types of algebraic structures. Within certain algebraic structures, it examines
the use of variables in equations and how to manipulate these equations.[4][b]
Algebra is often understood as a generalization of arithmetic.[8] Arithmetic studies operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in a particular domain of numbers, such as the real
numbers.[9] Elementary algebra constitutes the first level of abstraction. Like arithmetic, it restricts itself
to specific types of numbers and operations. It generalizes these operations by allowing indefinite
quantities in the form of variables in addition to numbers.[10] A higher level of abstraction is found in
abstract algebra, which is not limited to a particular domain and examines algebraic structures such as
groups and rings. It extends beyond typical arithmetic operations by also covering other types of
operations.[11] Universal algebra is still more abstract in that it is not interested in specific algebraic
structures but investigates the characteristics of algebraic structures in general.[12]
The term "algebra" is sometimes used in a more narrow sense to refer
only to elementary algebra or only to abstract algebra.[14] When used
as a countable noun, an algebra is a specific type of algebraic
structure that involves a vector space equipped with a certain type of
binary operation.[15] Depending on the context, "algebra" can also
refer to other algebraic structures, like a Lie algebra or an associative
algebra.[16]
The word algebra comes from the Arabic term ‫( الجبر‬al-jabr), which
originally referred to the surgical treatment of bonesetting. In the 9th
century, the term received a mathematical meaning when the Persian
mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi employed it to
describe a method of solving equations and used it in the title of a
treatise on algebra, al-Kitāb al-Mukhtaṣar fī Ḥisāb al-Jabr walMuqābalah [The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion
and Balancing] which was translated into Latin as Liber Algebrae et

meaning was restricted to the theory of equations, that is, to the art of
manipulating polynomial equations in view of solving them. This
changed in the 19th century[d] when the scope of algebra broadened to cover the study of diverse types of
algebraic operations and structures together with their underlying axioms, the laws they follow.[21]

Major branches
Elementary algebra
Elementary algebra, also called school algebra, college algebra, and classical algebra,[22] is the oldest and
most basic form of algebra. It is a generalization of arithmetic that relies on variables and examines how
mathematical statements may be transformed.[23]

Arithmetic is the study of numerical operations and
investigates how numbers are combined and transformed
using the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation, extraction of roots,
and logarithm. For example, the operation of addition
combines two numbers, called the addends, into a third

number, called the sum, as in

replacing the numbers with variables, it is possible to express
a general law that applies to any possible combination of numbers, like the commutative property of
multiplication, which is expressed in the equation
.[23]

Algebraic expressions are formed by using arithmetic operations to combine variables and numbers. By
convention, the lowercase letters ⁠ ⁠, ⁠ ⁠, and represent variables. In some cases, subscripts are added to
distinguish variables, as in ⁠ ⁠, ⁠ ⁠, and ⁠ ⁠. The lowercase letters ⁠ ⁠, ⁠ ⁠, and are usually used for constants
and coefficients.[e] The expression
is an algebraic expression created by multiplying the number 5
with the variable and adding the number 3 to the result. Other examples of algebraic expressions are
.[25]
and
Some algebraic expressions take the form of statements that relate two expressions to one another. An
equation is a statement formed by comparing two expressions, saying that they are equal. This can be
expressed using the equals sign (⁠ ⁠), as in ⁠
⁠. Inequations involve a different type of
comparison, saying that the two sides are different. This can be expressed using symbols such as the lessthan sign (⁠ ⁠), the greater-than sign (⁠ ⁠), and the inequality sign (⁠ ⁠). Unlike other expressions, statements
can be true or false, and their truth value usually depends on the values of the variables. For example, the
statement
is true if is either 2 or −2 and false otherwise.[26] Equations with variables can be
divided into identity equations and conditional equations. Identity equations are true for all values that
can be assigned to the variables, such as the equation ⁠
⁠. Conditional equations are only true
for some values. For example, the equation
is only true if is 5.[27]
The main goal of elementary algebra is to determine the values for which a statement is true. This can be
achieved by transforming and manipulating statements according to certain rules. A key principle guiding
this process is that whatever operation is applied to one side of an equation also needs to be done to the
other side. For example, if one subtracts 5 from the left side of an equation one also needs to subtract 5
from the right side to balance both sides. The goal of these steps is usually to isolate the variable one is
interested in on one side, a process known as solving the equation for that variable. For example, the
equation
can be solved for by adding 7 to both sides, which isolates on the left side and
results in the equation ⁠
⁠.[28]

There are many other techniques used to solve equations. Simplification is employed to replace a
complicated expression with an equivalent simpler one. For example, the expression
can be
[29]
replaced with the expression
since
by the distributive property.
For
statements with several variables, substitution is a common technique to replace one variable with an
equivalent expression that does not use this variable. For example, if one knows that
then one can
simplify the expression
to arrive at ⁠
⁠. In a similar way, if one knows the value of one variable
one may be able to use it to determine the value of other variables.[30]
Algebraic equations can be interpreted geometrically to
describe spatial figures in the form of a graph. To do so, the
different variables in the equation are understood as
coordinates and the values that solve the equation are
interpreted as points of a graph. For example, if is set to
zero in the equation ⁠
⁠, then must be −1 for the
equation to be true. This means that the
-pair
is
part of the graph of the equation. The
-pair ⁠
⁠, by
contrast, does not solve the equation and is therefore not part
of the graph. The graph encompasses the totality of
[31]
pairs that solve the equation.
Polynomials

Algebraic equations can be used to
describe geometric figures. All values for
and that solve the equation are
interpreted as points. They are drawn as
a red, upward-sloping line in the graph
above.

A polynomial is an expression consisting of one or more
terms that are added or subtracted from each other, like
⁠. Each term is either a constant, a
variable, or a product of a constant and variables. Each variable can be raised to a positive integer power.
A monomial is a polynomial with one term while two- and three-term polynomials are called binomials
and trinomials. The degree of a polynomial is the maximal value (among its terms) of the sum of the
exponents of the variables (4 in the above example).[32] Polynomials of degree one are called linear
polynomials. Linear algebra studies systems of linear polynomials.[33] A polynomial is said to be
univariate or multivariate, depending on whether it uses one or more variables.[34]
Factorization is a method used to simplify polynomials, making it easier to analyze them and determine
the values for which they evaluate to zero. Factorization consists of rewriting a polynomial as a product
of several factors. For example, the polynomial
can be factorized as ⁠
⁠. The
[35]
polynomial as a whole is zero if and only if one of its factors is zero, i.e., if is either −2 or 5.
Before
the 19th century, much of algebra was devoted to polynomial equations, that is equations obtained by
equating a polynomial to zero. The first attempts for solving polynomial equations were to express the
solutions in terms of nth roots. The solution of a second-degree polynomial equation of the form
is given by the quadratic formula[36]

Solutions for the degrees 3 and 4 are given by the cubic and quartic formulas. There are no general
solutions for higher degrees, as proven in the 19th century by the Abel–Ruffini theorem.[37] Even when
general solutions do not exist, approximate solutions can be found by numerical tools like the Newton–
Raphson method.[38]

The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that every univariate polynomial equation of positive degree
with real or complex coefficients has at least one complex solution. Consequently, every polynomial of a
positive degree can be factorized into linear polynomials. This theorem was proved at the beginning of
the 19th century, but this does not close the problem since the theorem does not provide any way for
computing the solutions.[39]

Linear algebra
Linear algebra starts with the study of systems of linear equations.[40] An equation is linear if it can be
expressed in the form ⁠
⁠, where ⁠ ⁠, ⁠ ⁠, ...,
and
are constants.
Examples are
and ⁠
⁠. A system of linear equations is a set of linear
equations for which one is interested in common solutions.[41]
Matrices are rectangular arrays of values that have been originally introduced for having a compact and
synthetic notation for systems of linear equations.[42] For example, the system of equations

can be written as

where ⁠ ⁠,

and

are the matrices

Under some conditions on the number of rows and columns, matrices can be added, multiplied, and
sometimes inverted. All methods for solving linear systems may be expressed as matrix manipulations
using these operations. For example, solving the above system consists of computing an inverted matrix
such that
where is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying on the left both members of
the above matrix equation by
one gets the solution of the system of linear equations as[43]

Methods of solving systems of linear equations range from the introductory, like substitution[44] and
elimination,[45] to more advanced techniques using matrices, such as Cramer's rule, the Gaussian
elimination, and LU decomposition.[46] Some systems of equations are inconsistent, meaning that no
solutions exist because the equations contradict each other.[47][f] Consistent systems have either one
unique solution or an infinite number of solutions.[48][g]
The study of vector spaces and linear maps form a large part of linear algebra. A vector space is an
algebraic structure formed by a set with an addition that makes it an abelian group and a scalar
multiplication that is compatible with addition (see vector space for details). A linear map is a function
between vector spaces that is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication. In the case of finitedimensional vector spaces, vectors and linear maps can be represented by matrices. It follows that the
theories of matrices and finite-dimensional vector spaces are essentially the same. In particular, vector
spaces provide a third way for expressing and manipulating systems of linear equations.[49] From this

perspective, a matrix is a representation of a linear map: if one chooses a particular basis to describe the
vectors being transformed, then the entries in the matrix give the results of applying the linear map to the
basis vectors.[50]
Systems of equations can be interpreted as geometric figures.
For systems with two variables, each equation represents a
line in two-dimensional space. The point where the two lines
intersect is the solution of the full system because this is the
only point that solves both the first and the second equation.
For inconsistent systems, the two lines run parallel, meaning
that there is no solution since they never intersect. If two
equations are not independent then they describe the same
line, meaning that every solution of one equation is also a
solution of the other equation. These relations make it
possible to seek solutions graphically by plotting the
equations and determining where they intersect.[51] The same
principles also apply to systems of equations with more
variables, with the difference being that the equations do not
describe lines but higher dimensional figures. For instance,
equations with three variables correspond to planes in threedimensional space, and the points where all planes intersect
solve the system of equations.[52]

Linear equations with two variables can
be interpreted geometrically as lines. The
solution of a system of linear equations is
where the lines intersect.

Abstract algebra
Abstract algebra, also called modern algebra,[53] is the study of algebraic structures. An algebraic
structure is a framework for understanding operations on mathematical objects, like the addition of
numbers. While elementary algebra and linear algebra work within the confines of particular algebraic
structures, abstract algebra takes a more general approach that compares how algebraic structures differ
from each other and what types of algebraic structures there are, such as groups, rings, and fields.[54] The
key difference between these types of algebraic structures lies in the number of operations they use and
the laws they obey.[55] In mathematics education, abstract algebra refers to an advanced undergraduate
course that mathematics majors take after completing courses in linear algebra.[56]
On a formal level, an algebraic structure is a set[h] of mathematical objects, called the underlying set,
together with one or several operations.[i] Abstract algebra is primarily interested in binary operations,[j]
which take any two objects from the underlying set as inputs and map them to another object from this set
as output.[60] For example, the algebraic structure
has the natural numbers (⁠ ⁠) as the underlying
[58]
set and addition (⁠ ⁠) as its binary operation.
The underlying set can contain mathematical objects other
than numbers, and the operations are not restricted to regular arithmetic operations.[61] For instance, the
underlying set of the symmetry group of a geometric object is made up of geometric transformations,
such as rotations, under which the object remains unchanged. Its binary operation is function
composition, which takes two transformations as input and has the transformation resulting from applying
the first transformation followed by the second as its output.[62]

Group theory
Abstract algebra classifies algebraic structures based on the
laws or axioms that its operations obey and the number of
operations it uses. One of the most basic types is a group,
which has one operation and requires that this operation is
associative and has an identity element and inverse elements.
An operation is associative if the order of several applications
[k] is the same as

.[65] The natural numbers with

addition, by contrast, do not form a group since they contain only positive integers and therefore lack
inverse elements.[66]
Group theory examines the nature of groups, with basic theorems such as the fundamental theorem of
finite abelian groups and the Feit–Thompson theorem.[67] The latter was a key early step in one of the
most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century: the collaborative effort, taking up more
than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 2004, that culminated in a complete
classification of finite simple groups.[68]
Ring theory and field theory
A ring is an algebraic structure with two operations that work similarly to the addition and multiplication
of numbers and are named and generally denoted similarly. A ring is a commutative group under addition:
the addition of the ring is associative, commutative, and has an identity element and inverse elements.
The multiplication is associative and distributive with respect to addition; that is,
and
Moreover, multiplication is associative and has an identity element generally
[69][l]
denoted as 1.
Multiplication needs not to be commutative; if it is commutative, one has a
[71]
commutative ring.
The ring of integers (⁠ ⁠) is one of the simplest commutative rings.[72]
A field is a commutative ring such that ⁠
⁠ and each nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.[73]
The ring of integers does not form a field because it lacks multiplicative inverses. For example, the
multiplicative inverse of is ⁠ ⁠, which is not an integer. The rational numbers, the real numbers, and the
complex numbers each form a field with the operations of addition and multiplication.[74]
Ring theory is the study of rings, exploring concepts such as subrings, quotient rings, polynomial rings,
and ideals as well as theorems such as Hilbert's basis theorem.[75] Field theory is concerned with fields,
examining field extensions, algebraic closures, and finite fields.[76] Galois theory explores the relation
between field theory and group theory, relying on the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.[77]

Theories of interrelations among structures
Besides groups, rings, and fields, there are many other
algebraic structures studied by algebra. They include
magmas, semigroups, monoids, abelian groups, commutative
rings, modules, lattices, vector spaces, algebras over a field,
and associative and non-associative algebras. They differ
from each other regarding the types of objects they describe
and the requirements that their operations fulfill. Many are
related to each other in that a basic structure can be turned
into a more specialized structure by adding constraints.[55]
For example, a magma becomes a semigroup if its operation
is associative.[78]
Diagram of relations between some
algebraic structures. For instance, its top
right section shows that a magma
becomes a semigroup if its operation is
associative.

Homomorphisms are tools to examine structural features by
comparing two algebraic structures.[79] A homomorphism is a
function from the underlying set of one algebraic structure to
the underlying set of another algebraic structure that
preserves certain structural characteristics. If the two
algebraic structures use binary operations and have the form
and
then the function
is a homomorphism if it fulfills the following requirement: ⁠
⁠. The
existence of a homomorphism reveals that the operation in the second algebraic structure plays the
same role as the operation does in the first algebraic structure.[80] Isomorphisms are a special type of
homomorphism that indicates a high degree of similarity between two algebraic structures. An
isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism, meaning that it establishes a one-to-one relationship between
the elements of the two algebraic structures. This implies that every element of the first algebraic
structure is mapped to one unique element in the second structure without any unmapped elements in the
second structure.[81]
Another tool of comparison is the relation between an
algebraic structure and its subalgebra.[82] The algebraic
structure and its subalgebra use the same operations,[m] which
follow the same axioms. The only difference is that the
underlying set of the subalgebra is a subset of the underlying
set of the algebraic structure.[n] All operations in the
subalgebra are required to be closed in its underlying set,
meaning that they only produce elements that belong to this
set.[82] For example, the set of even integers together with
addition is a subalgebra of the full set of integers together
with addition. This is the case because the sum of two even
numbers is again an even number. But the set of odd integers
together with addition is not a subalgebra because it is not
closed: adding two odd numbers produces an even number,
which is not part of the chosen subset.[83]

Subalgebras restrict their operations to a
subset of the underlying set of the
original algebraic structure.

Universal algebra is the study of algebraic structures in
general. As part of its general perspective, it is not concerned with the specific elements that make up the
underlying sets and considers operations with more than two inputs, such as ternary operations. It

provides a framework for investigating what structural features different algebraic structures have in
common.[85][o] One of those structural features concerns the identities that are true in different algebraic
structures. In this context, an identity is a universal equation or an equation that is true for all elements of
the underlying set. For example, commutativity is a universal equation that states that
is identical to
[87]
for all elements.
A variety is a class of all algebraic structures that satisfy certain identities. For
example, if two algebraic structures satisfy commutativity then they are both part of the corresponding
variety.[88][p][q]
Category theory examines how mathematical objects are related to each other using the concept of
categories. A category is a collection of objects together with a collection of morphisms or "arrows"
between those objects. These two collections must satisfy certain conditions. For example, morphisms
can be joined, or composed: if there exists a morphism from object to object ⁠ ⁠, and another morphism
from object to object ⁠ ⁠, then there must also exist one from object to object ⁠ ⁠. Composition of
morphisms is required to be associative, and there must be an "identity morphism" for every object.[92]
Categories are widely used in contemporary mathematics since they provide a unifying framework to
describe and analyze many fundamental mathematical concepts. For example, sets can be described with
the category of sets, and any group can be regarded as the morphisms of a category with just one
object.[93]

History
The origin of algebra lies in attempts to solve mathematical
problems involving arithmetic calculations and unknown
quantities. These developments happened in the ancient
period in Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, China, and India. One of
the earliest documents on algebraic problems is the Rhind
Mathematical Papyrus from ancient Egypt, which was written
around 1650 BCE.[r] It discusses solutions to linear equations,
as expressed in problems like "A quantity; its fourth is added
to it. It becomes fifteen. What is the quantity?" Babylonian
clay tablets from around the same time explain methods to
solve linear and quadratic polynomial equations, such as the
method of completing the square.[95]

The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus from
ancient Egypt, dated c. 1650 BCE, is one
of the earliest documents discussing
algebraic problems.

Many of these insights found their way to the ancient Greeks. Starting in the 6th century BCE, their main
interest was geometry rather than algebra, but they employed algebraic methods to solve geometric
problems. For example, they studied geometric figures while taking their lengths and areas as unknown
quantities to be determined, as exemplified in Pythagoras' formulation of the difference of two squares
method and later in Euclid's Elements.[96] In the 3rd century CE, Diophantus provided a detailed
treatment of how to solve algebraic equations in a series of books called Arithmetica. He was the first to
experiment with symbolic notation to express polynomials.[97] Diophantus's work influenced Arab
development of algebra with many of his methods reflected in the concepts and techniques used in
medieval Arabic algebra.[98] In ancient China, The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, a book
composed over the period spanning from the 10th century BCE to the 2nd century CE,[99] explored
various techniques for solving algebraic equations, including the use of matrix-like constructs.[100]

There is no unanimity of opinion as to whether these early developments are part of algebra or only
precursors. They offered solutions to algebraic problems but did not conceive them in an abstract and
general manner, focusing instead on specific cases and applications.[101] This changed with the Persian
mathematician al-Khwarizmi,[s] who published his The Compendious Book on Calculation by
Completion and Balancing in 825 CE. It presents the first detailed treatment of general methods that can
be used to manipulate linear and quadratic equations by "reducing" and "balancing" both sides.[103] Other
influential contributions to algebra came from the Arab mathematician Thābit ibn Qurra also in the 9th
century and the Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam in the 11th and 12th centuries.[104]
In India, Brahmagupta investigated how to solve quadratic equations and systems of equations with
several variables in the 7th century CE. Among his innovations were the use of zero and negative
numbers in algebraic equations.[105] The Indian mathematicians Mahāvīra in the 9th century and
Bhāskara II in the 12th century further refined Brahmagupta's methods and concepts.[106] In 1247, the
Chinese mathematician Qin Jiushao wrote the Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections, which includes an
algorithm for the numerical evaluation of polynomials, including polynomials of higher degrees.[107]

François Viète (left) and René Descartes invented a symbolic notation to express equations in an abstract
and concise manner.

The Italian mathematician Fibonacci brought al-Khwarizmi's ideas and techniques to Europe in books
including his Liber Abaci.[108] In 1545, the Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano published his book Ars
Magna, which covered many topics in algebra, discussed imaginary numbers, and was the first to present
general methods for solving cubic and quartic equations.[109] In the 16th and 17th centuries, the French
mathematicians François Viète and René Descartes introduced letters and symbols to denote variables and
operations, making it possible to express equations in an concise and abstract manner. Their predecessors
had relied on verbal descriptions of problems and solutions.[110] Some historians see this development as
a key turning point in the history of algebra and consider what came before it as the prehistory of algebra
because it lacked the abstract nature based on symbolic manipulation.[111]
In the 17th and 18th centuries, many attempts were made to find general solutions to polynomials of
degree five and higher. All of them failed.[37] At the end of the 18th century, the German mathematician
Carl Friedrich Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, which describes the existence of zeros
of polynomials of any degree without providing a general solution.[19] At the beginning of the 19th
century, the Italian mathematician Paolo Ruffini and the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel
were able to show that no general solution exists for polynomials of degree five and higher.[37] In
response to and shortly after their findings, the French mathematician Évariste Galois developed what

came later to be known as Galois theory, which offered a more in-depth analysis of the solutions of
polynomials while also laying the foundation of group theory.[20] Mathematicians soon realized the
relevance of group theory to other fields and applied it to disciplines like geometry and number
theory.[112]
Starting in the mid-19th century, interest in algebra shifted from the
study of polynomials associated with elementary algebra towards a
more general inquiry into algebraic structures, marking the
emergence of abstract algebra. This approach explored the axiomatic
basis of arbitrary algebraic operations.[113] The invention of new
algebraic systems based on different operations and elements
accompanied this development, such as Boolean algebra, vector
algebra, and matrix algebra.[114] Influential early developments in
abstract algebra were made by the German mathematicians David
Hilbert, Ernst Steinitz, and Emmy Noether as well as the Austrian
mathematician Emil Artin. They researched different forms of
algebraic structures and categorized them based on their underlying
axioms into types, like groups, rings, and fields.[115]
The idea of the even more general approach associated with universal
algebra was conceived by the English mathematician Alfred North
Whitehead in his 1898 book A Treatise on Universal Algebra.
Starting in the 1930s, the American mathematician Garrett Birkhoff
expanded these ideas and developed many of the foundational
[116]
concepts of this field.
The invention of universal algebra led to the emergence of various new areas
focused on the algebraization of mathematics—that is, the application of algebraic methods to other
branches of mathematics. Topological algebra arose in the early 20th century, studying algebraic
structures such as topological groups and Lie groups.[117] In the 1940s and 50s, homological algebra
emerged, employing algebraic techniques to study homology.[118] Around the same time, category theory
was developed and has since played a key role in the foundations of mathematics.[119] Other
developments were the formulation of model theory and the study of free algebras.[120]
Garrett Birkhoff developed many
of the foundational concepts of
universal algebra.

Applications
The influence of algebra is wide-reaching, both within mathematics and in its applications to other
fields.[121] The algebraization of mathematics is the process of applying algebraic methods and principles
to other branches of mathematics, such as geometry, topology, number theory, and calculus. It happens by
employing symbols in the form of variables to express mathematical insights on a more general level,
allowing mathematicians to develop formal models describing how objects interact and relate to each
other.[122]
One application, found in geometry, is the use of algebraic statements to describe geometric figures. For
example, the equation
describes a line in two-dimensional space while the equation
corresponds to a sphere in three-dimensional space. Of special interest to algebraic
geometry are algebraic varieties,[t] which are solutions to systems of polynomial equations that can be
used to describe more complex geometric figures.[124] Algebraic reasoning can also solve geometric

problems. For example, one can determine whether and
where the line described by
intersects with the
circle described by
by solving the system of
equations made up of these two equations.[125] Topology
studies the properties of geometric figures or topological
spaces that are preserved under operations of continuous
deformation. Algebraic topology relies on algebraic theories
such as group theory to classify topological spaces. For
example, homotopy groups classify topological spaces based
on the existence of loops or holes in them.[126]
Number theory is concerned with the properties of and
relations between integers. Algebraic number theory applies
algebraic methods and principles to this field of inquiry.
The algebraic equation

structures to analyze the behavior of numbers, such as the
ring of integers.[127] The related field of combinatorics uses
algebraic techniques to solve problems related to counting, arrangement, and combination of discrete
objects. An example in algebraic combinatorics is the application of group theory to analyze graphs and
symmetries.[128] The insights of algebra are also relevant to calculus, which uses mathematical
expressions to examine rates of change and accumulation. It relies on algebra, for instance, to understand
how these expressions can be transformed and what role variables play in them.[129] Algebraic logic
employs the methods of algebra to describe and analyze the structures and patterns that underlie logical
reasoning,[130] exploring both the relevant mathematical structures themselves and their application to
concrete problems of logic.[131] It includes the study of Boolean algebra to describe propositional
logic[132] as well as the formulation and analysis of algebraic structures corresponding to more complex
systems of logic.[133]
Algebraic methods are also commonly employed in other areas, like
the natural sciences. For example, they are used to express scientific
laws and solve equations in physics, chemistry, and biology.[135]
Similar applications are found in fields like economics, geography,
engineering (including electronics and robotics), and computer
science to express relationships, solve problems, and model
systems.[136] Linear algebra plays a central role in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, for instance, by enabling the
efficient processing and analysis of large datasets.[137] Various fields
rely on algebraic structures investigated by abstract algebra. For
example, physical sciences like crystallography and quantum
mechanics make extensive use of group theory,[138] which is also
employed to study puzzles such as Sudoku and Rubik's cubes,[139]
and origami.[140] Both coding theory and cryptology rely on abstract
algebra to solve problems associated with data transmission, like
avoiding the effects of noise and ensuring data security.[141]

The faces of a Rubik's cube can
be rotated to change the
arrangement of colored patches.
The resulting permutations form
a group called the Rubik's Cube
group.[134]

Education
Algebra education mostly focuses on elementary
algebra, which is one of the reasons why
elementary algebra is also called school algebra.
It is usually not introduced until secondary
education since it requires mastery of the
fundamentals of arithmetic while posing new
Balance scales are used in algebra education to help

familiarize students with the formal side of
mathematics by helping them understand
mathematical symbolism, for example, how variables can be used to represent unknown quantities. An
additional difficulty for students lies in the fact that, unlike arithmetic calculations, algebraic expressions
are often difficult to solve directly. Instead, students need to learn how to transform them according to
certain laws, often to determine an unknown quantity.[144]
Some tools to introduce students to the abstract side of algebra rely on concrete models and visualizations
of equations, including geometric analogies, manipulatives including sticks or cups, and "function
machines" representing equations as flow diagrams. One method uses balance scales as a pictorial
approach to help students grasp basic problems of algebra. The mass of some objects on the scale is
unknown and represents variables. Solving an equation corresponds to adding and removing objects on
both sides in such a way that the sides stay in balance until the only object remaining on one side is the
object of unknown mass.[145] Word problems are another tool to show how algebra is applied to real-life
situations. For example, students may be presented with a situation in which Naomi's brother has twice as
many apples as Naomi. Given that both together have twelve apples, students are then asked to find an
algebraic equation that describes this situation (⁠
⁠) and to determine how many apples Naomi
[146]
⁠).
has (⁠
At the university level, mathematics students encounter advanced algebra topics from linear and abstract
algebra. Initial undergraduate courses in linear algebra focus on matrices, vector spaces, and linear maps.
Upon completing them, students are usually introduced to abstract algebra, where they learn about
algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields, as well as the relations between them. The curriculum
typically also covers specific instances of algebraic structures, such as the systems of rational numbers,
the real numbers, and the polynomials.[147]

Notes
a. When understood in the widest sense, an algebraic operation is a function from a Cartesian
⁠. The addition of real
power of a set into that set, expressed formally as ⁠
numbers is an example of an algebraic operation: it takes two numbers as input and
.[3]
produces one number as output. It has the form
b. Algebra is covered by division 512 in the Dewey Decimal Classification[5] and subclass QA
150-272.5 in the Library of Congress Classification.[6] It encompasses several areas in the
Mathematics Subject Classification.[7]
c. The exact meaning of the term al-jabr in al-Khwarizmi's work is disputed. In some passages,
it expresses that a quantity diminished by subtraction is restored to its original value, similar
to how a bonesetter restores broken bones by bringing them into proper alignment.[17]
d. These changes were in part triggered by discoveries that solved many of the older problems
of algebra. For example, the proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra demonstrated the
existence of complex solutions of polynomials[19] and the introduction of Galois theory
characterized the polynomials that have general solutions.[20]
e. Constants represent fixed numbers that do not change during the study of a specific
problem.[24]
f. For example, the equations
and
contradict each other since no
values of
and
exist that solve both equations at the same time.[47]
g. Whether a consistent system of equations has a unique solution depends on the number of
variables and independent equations. Several equations are independent of each other if
they do not provide the same information and cannot be derived from each other. A unique
solution exists if the number of variables is the same as the number of independent
equations. Underdetermined systems, by contrast, have more variables than independent
equations and have an infinite number of solutions if they are consistent.[48]
h. A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements, such as numbers, vectors, or other
sets. Set theory describes the laws and properties of sets.[57]
i. According to some definitions, algebraic structures include a distinguished element as an
additional component, such as the identity element in the case of multiplication.[58]
j. Some of the algebraic structures studied by abstract algebra include unary operations in
addition to binary operations. For example, normed vector spaces have a norm, which is a
unary operation often used to associate a vector with its length.[59]
k. The symbols and are used in this article to represent any operation that may or may not
resemble arithmetic operations.[63]
l. Some authors do not require the existence of multiplicative identity elements. A ring without
multiplicative identity is sometimes called a rng.[70]
m. According to some definitions, it is also possible for a subalgebra to have fewer
operations.[83]
n. This means that all the elements of the first set are also elements of the second set but the
second set may contain elements not found in the first set.[84]
o. A slightly different approach understands universal algebra as the study of one type of
algebraic structures known as universal algebras. Universal algebras are defined in a
general manner to include most other algebraic structures. For example, groups and rings
are special types of universal algebras.[86]

p. Not every type of algebraic structure forms a variety. For example, both groups and rings
form varieties but fields do not.[89]
q. Besides identities, universal algebra is also interested in structural features associated with
quasi-identities. A quasi-identity is an identity that only needs to be present under certain
conditions (which take the form of a Horn clause[90]). It is a generalization of identity in the
sense that every identity is a quasi-identity but not every quasi-identity is an identity. A
quasivariety is a class of all algebraic structures that satisfy certain quasi-identities.[91]
r. The exact date is disputed and some historians suggest a later date around 1550 BCE.[94]
s. Some historians consider him the "father of algebra" while others reserve this title for
Diophantus.[102]
t. Algebraic varieties studied in geometry differ from the more general varieties studied in
universal algebra.[123]
